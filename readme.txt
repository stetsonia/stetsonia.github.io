 # The server will automatically rebuild the site upon saving. 
 # Start it with:
 mkdocs serve
 
 # If you're only interested in the current page, the --dirtyreload flag will make rebuilds much faster:
 mmkdocs serve --dirtyreload

 # Supported Markdown extensions that are natively integrated with Material for MkDocs
 https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/setup/extensions/
 
 # When you're finished editing, you can build a static site from your Markdown files with:
 mkdocs build
 
 The contents of this directory make up your project documentation. 
 There's no need for operating a database or server, as it is completely self-contained. 
 The site can be hosted on GitHub Pages, GitLab Pages, a CDN of your choice or your private web space.
